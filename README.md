## Special adding Coding challenge

Print a new number by adding one to each of its digit

### Description
A number is input in computer then a new no should get printed by adding one to each of its digit. If you encounter a `9`, insert a `10` (don't carry over, just shift things around).

For example, `998` becomes `10109`.
